                <p>My favourite fruit of all time, especially when eaten with groundnut!!! Bananas are <strong>yummy and filled with <em>fibre</em></strong>, which makes them very satisfying.</p>
                <p>Bananas are of different kinds, two of which are popularly grown in the western part of Nigeria; they are: <strong>Paranta... </strong>I hope i spelt it correctly as an Igbo lady, loool; the second one is <strong>Ọ̀gẹ̀dẹ̀ ọ̀mìnì</strong> and finally <strong>Saaro,<em> also called Igbo banana</em> grown in the eastern part of Nigeria</strong>. Paranta is actually my favourite because it is less sugary than the rest.</p>
